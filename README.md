- 👋 What is the ArtSect?

ArtSect DAO is a Decentralised Arts Organisation, based In Real Life from our
NFT Gallery in London. Our mission is to demonstrate the potential of NFTs through immersive and interactive exhibitions, support the development of open sourced peer-to-peer creative ideation with web3 technology and continue our acquisition of Phygital assets.

- 👀 How does ArtSect operate?

We activate creative ideas, exhibitions and immersive interactive experiences in the public realm IRL, in the metaverse or with a Phygital Blend.
The Sect council is made up of experts from all corners of the creative media industries and a strategic roadmap to becoming a powerful catalyst in the global Decentralised Arts Movement. Our decisions are made as a collective.
We are incubating NFT projects in-house, helping launch several metaverse worlds and governing a diverse treasury of DAO and token lead NFT projects, as a result of our front running. As crypto native creatives we collaborate first hand in the DAO-to-DAO ecosystem and secondly in the realm of public education and onboarding into the wider blockchain ecosystem.

- 🌱 ArtSect growth web:

We will focus our initial expansion in these 5 key areas:
Decentralised Arts education & onboarding
NFT / Metaverse Activations and Exhibition experiences
DAO-to-DAO support
Social Tokens & DeFi-NFTs
Node development and Staked communities

-🧞‍♀️ Can I join the ArtSect DAO council?

Artsect DAO is currently in a closed pre-seed round (August 2021) with the core team and initial investors and contributors.
We will be opening the doors to public initiation in October 2021 to coincide with a Phygital exhibition planned. This next round of public access will be membership through NFT donation, open to creative individuals and groups only and voted for solely by the community.
There will then be a further phase of social tokenisation to be released publicly in early 2022 to align with a metaverse project launch from our DAO-to-DAO family:)

- 📫 How do I get involved now?
